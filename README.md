# DeepDRiD: Deep Learning for Diabetic Retinopathy Image Classification

This repository provides a deep learning-based framework for classifying diabetic retinopathy images using pre-trained models and custom training techniques. The framework leverages several ensemble learning techniques, image preprocessing methods, and model interpretability tools like GradCAM for enhanced performance and insights into model predictions.

## Overview

The project uses deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the severity of diabetic retinopathy from retina images. The key components of the project are:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Various image preprocessing techniques to enhance model performance.
- **Model Training**: Pre-trained models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet) fine-tuned on the dataset.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combining predictions from different models using max voting and weighted average.
- **GradCAM**: Visualizing model predictions to understand what parts of the image are being used by the model.
- **Training Logs and Visualization**: Detailed logs and plots of training and validation losses and accuracies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- torchvision 0.9+
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- Pillow
- json

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepdrid.git
cd deepdrid
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have a working GPU (CUDA-enabled) if you plan to train models. The code will automatically fall back to CPU if CUDA is not available.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of retina images with labels indicating the severity of diabetic retinopathy. The dataset should be structured as follows:

```
/data
    /train
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    /val
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    train.csv
    val.csv
```

### CSV File Structure

Both `train.csv` and `val.csv` should contain the following columns:
- `img_path`: Relative path to the image in the dataset.
- `Overall quality`: The label indicating the severity of diabetic retinopathy (integer value from 0 to 4).

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will:
- Load the training and validation data from the specified directories and CSV files.
- Apply necessary transformations and preprocessing steps to the images.
- Train each model (ResNet18, DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B0) for 15 epochs.
- Log the training/validation performance in JSON format.
- Perform ensemble learning (max voting and weighted average).
- Save the ensemble results in `ensemble_results.json`.

### Visualizing Training Performance

To plot training and validation losses/accuracies:

```bash
python plot_training.py
```

This will display a plot comparing the performance of the models during training and validation.

### GradCAM Visualization

To generate GradCAM visualizations for a sample image in the validation set:

```bash
python gradcam.py
```

This will:
- Select a sample image from the validation set.
- Generate a GradCAM heatmap to highlight the regions of the image that contributed the most to the model's prediction.
- Save the GradCAM visualization as `gradcam_taskE.png`.

## Code Structure

```
/data
    /train                # Training images
    /val                  # Validation images
    train.csv             # Training CSV file with image paths and labels
    val.csv               # Validation CSV file with image paths and labels
/train.py                # Script to train the models
/plot_training.py        # Script to plot training and validation metrics
/gradcam.py              # Script to generate and visualize GradCAM
/models                  # Contains pre-trained models and custom network definitions
/utils                   # Helper functions for data loading, preprocessing, etc.
```

## Model Architecture

The following models are used in this project:
- **ResNet-18**: A 18-layer residual network for image classification.
- **DenseNet-121**: A densely connected convolutional network.
- **EfficientNet-B0**: A more efficient and lightweight model with excellent performance.

### Fine-tuning the Models

The models are pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on the provided dataset. The final fully connected layers of the networks are replaced with a new layer that outputs the number of classes (5 in this case).

## Results

Ensemble learning is applied to the models, combining their predictions using two techniques:
- **Max Voting**: The class with the highest count across the models' predictions is chosen.
- **Weighted Average**: A weighted average of the models' predictions is calculated, and the class with the highest value is selected.

Cohenâ€™s Kappa score is used to evaluate the performance of the ensemble predictions.
